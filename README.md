# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description 
This project is a page with the task of generating a password based on a user's preferred parameters. If you're having trouble deciding on a password, why not solve this issue by handing the task to a random generator? The project explores javascript, specifically arrays, and functions related to it. A "for loop" and an "if else" statement are also used. The prompt() and confirm() methods were also used to gather user input, and logical operators were used to validate input. The combination of the aforementioned code was learned to finalize this working web application. If you're interested in a more detailed explanation, check out the javascript file in the project directory.

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

When you first open the page, you can see an empty box where a password will be generated and shown once you press the "Generate Password" button below the box **(Img 1)** .

 After the button is pressed you will be prompted with requests for your desired password parameters. You will be prompted with a request for password length between 8 and 138 characters, followed by a lowercase, uppercase, special characters, and number prompts that the user can select from **(Img 2)**. 
 
 After all prompts are answered, a new password will be generated in the previously empty box **(Img 3)**.
